Exercise Task #1:
Given the list nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].
Return the list in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].


Exercise Task #2:
Given two files inputA and inputB that contain one word each of them. 
Write an algorithm to determine if the word in the inputA file is an anagram of the word in the inputB file.


Exercise Task #3:
Given a non-empty list of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.


Exercise Task #4:
Given a list nums. We define a running sum of a list as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
Return the running sum of nums.


Exercise Task #5:
Given an encrypted text t and value s. Write an algorithm that will decrypt the text by moving each letter by s numbers in an alphabet. For example if the input is a and s is equal to 3, the algorithm must return d. (a,b,c,d)
